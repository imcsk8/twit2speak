Simple script that converts a tweet to speech :P

this program is licensed by the GNU license so you know what to do ;) http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html

in order yo use it you need to:
install the next programs and perl packages
espeak
debian(s)
apt-get install espeak 

Gentoo
emerge app-accessibility/espeak

Net::Twitter
ubuntu(s)
apt-get install libnet-twitter-perl

Gentoo
emerge dev-perl/Net-Twitter

you also have to create a twitter app and add the consumer_key, consumer_secret, token and token_secret
to the appropiate variables

If you have any problem, addition or bugfix contact me: @imcsk8 <ichavero at chavero.com.mx>
The code is at https://github.com/imcsk8/twit2speak so fork it fix it and extend it  :)

this is a quick hack so there's no server or anything.
if you want to be bothered by your friends constantly
you can put the program on your cron or use this little bash magic:

while [ 1 ]; do ./twit2speak.pl; sleep 10 ; done

have fun :)
